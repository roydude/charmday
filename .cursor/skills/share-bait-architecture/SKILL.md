# Share-Bait Architecture

## The "Meme Card" Layout
- **Container**: The result must be visually isolated in a "Card" or "Ticket" designed for a 9:16 aspect ratio.
- **Visual Density**:
  - **Headline**: Provocative or funny summary.
  - **Hero Image**: One strong visual (Generative AI image or large Emoji).
  - **Stats/Data**: Hexagon charts, progress bars, or "Power Levels."
- **Footer**: A distinctive brand stamp or QR code.

## Monetization Flow (The Hook)
- **Contextual Linking**: The Coupang link is not an ad; it is a "Solution" or "Reward."
  - *Bad*: "Buy this item."
  - *Good*: "The only item that can save your destiny." / "Equip this to survive."
- **Button Hierarchy**:
  - Primary CTA: "Share Result" (Viral Loop)
  - Secondary CTA: "Check Lucky Item" (Revenue Loop) — Give this a distinct, shiny style.

## When Applying This Skill
1. Structure the result view as a shareable card (9:16-friendly).
2. Place headline, hero visual, and stats with clear hierarchy.
3. Define Primary (Share) and Secondary (Monetization) CTAs with distinct styling and copy.
