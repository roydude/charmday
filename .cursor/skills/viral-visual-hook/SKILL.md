# Viral Visual Hook

## Core Philosophy
Design for a 3-second attention span.
- **Anti-Boredom**: Never use a standard "Header-Hero-Footer" layout. Break the grid.
- **Theme Commitment**: Pick one extreme aesthetic and apply it to 100% of the UI elements.

## Aesthetic Modes (Select One based on Context)
1. **Y2K / Cyber-trash**:
   - *Keywords*: Glitch, Neon, Pixelated, Raw HTML, Marquee tags.
   - *Colors*: #00FF00 (Lime), #FF00FF (Magenta) on #000000.
   - *Vibe*: "Matrix meets MySpace."
2. **New-tro / Oriental-Occult**:
   - *Keywords*: Talisman(부적), Hanji(Paper) texture, Vertical text, Stamp effects.
   - *Colors*: Faded red, Deep navy, Gold foil textures.
   - *Vibe*: "Digital Shaman."
3. **Brutalist / Raw**:
   - *Keywords*: Default system fonts, Thick black borders (3px+), High contrast, Oversized elements.
   - *Colors*: B&W only, or Primary Blue/Red.
   - *Vibe*: "This isn't a design, it's a statement."
4. **Soft-Pop / K-Teen**:
   - *Keywords*: Rounded corners (24px+), Pastel gradients, 3D clay icons, Soft shadows.
   - *Colors*: Butter Yellow, Baby Blue, Soft Pink.
   - *Vibe*: "Cute, Harmless, Addictive."

## Execution Rules
- **Backgrounds**: Never use solid white. Use noise textures, repeating emoji patterns, or slow-moving gradient blobs.
- **Containers**: Use "Physical Metaphors" for containers (e.g., Windows 95 box, Paper receipt, Game cartridge).

## When Applying This Skill
1. Confirm the chosen aesthetic mode (or suggest one from context).
2. Output CSS variables and layout rules that match the mode.
3. Apply the rules to all UI elements consistently.
